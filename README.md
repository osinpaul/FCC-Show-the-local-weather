Welcome to the FreeCodeCamp: show the local weather App!

This is my second Intermediate Front-End Development Project on FreeCodeCamp. This App uses FCC Weather API, that recieve JSON object after GET requsting to the server. GET request include longitude and latitude, that recieving from the  browser with HTML5 geolocation API (https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_geolocation.asp)

My App follow the next user stories:

+ User Story: I can see the weather in my current location.

+ User Story: I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather. 
// There are both realizations: background-color changing coming relatively with weather and cool weather icon from FCC JSON :)

User Story: I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
// You can click on temperature to switch this one stuff.


You can try it yourself on the demo page: https://osinpaul.ru/projects/weather/.

Good luck!
